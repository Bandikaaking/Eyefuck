# BIG UPDATE!!!

now **Eyefuck** can be COMPILED and INTERPRETERD and REPL-ed!!

see?

all you need is just FASM

## install `FASM` in **Windows**

*(i recommend doing it via scoop)*

```bash
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

Invoke-RestMethod -Uri https://get.scoop.sh | Invoke-Expression

scoop bucket add extras

scoop install fasm

```

## Install ``FASM`` (the CLI command) in linux / BSD distros:

with `apt` (on DEBIAN-based systems, like: Ubuntu,Debian,Pop!_Os etc. et.c)
```bash
sudo apt update 
sudo apt install fasm
```


On Red-Hat-based systems (like Fedora,Red hat linux,AlmaLinux, ClearOS)

Becuse i am a windows user **do not know if red hat based systems have the CLI FASM, in their package.

```bash
dnf seach fasm
sudo dnf install fasm # only if found
```
if there is no fasm, you can download the **Official Binary**
```bash
wget https://flatassembler.net/download.php
tar -xvzf fasm-1.73.23.tgz
sudo mv fasm/fasm /usr/local/bin/
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/fasm
```

Arch-Based distros (Manjaro, Endveavour etc.)
In arch-based distros they have fasm in AUR

```bash
sudo pacman -S fasm
```
or with AUR, if it is not in the core rep
```bash
yay -S fasm
```

BSD distros:

```bash
pkg install fasm
```

SUSE system-s:
```bash
sudo zypper install fasm
```

**EyeFuck** is a lightweight Brainfuck-like language and interpreter, created by Bandika in 2025.  
It features a simpler syntax, a complete interpreter, and a  **__REPL__** mode. It also features 2 more commands



## Installation

### Windows
1. Run `buildwin.bat` **as Administrator**.
2. This will compile `eyefuck.rs` and place `eyefuck.exe` in `C:\Windows`.

*(Don't be afraid cus it copies it to C:\Windows no problem will occuer commands like "qemu" is in C:\Windows cus it is already in PATH)*
### How to get Syntax Higliting

First you will see a syntaxes.vsix in the syntax/ folder



![step1](/src/pictures/win3.png)

Next you need to go to the **Extension Manager**, Press CTR+SHIFT+X

then, you would find 3 dots, click on it, then select *"Install from VSIX..."*

![step2](/src/pictures/Windows1.png)

then select the syntaxes.vsix

![step3](/src/pictures/windows2.png)
